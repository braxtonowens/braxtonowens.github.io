Currently, I am a PhD student at BYU working in the [Biophysics](https://byu-biophysics.github.io/) group. I have the privilege of working with wonderful scientists like [Grant Jensen](https://jensenlab.byu.edu/), [Bryan Morse](https://cs.byu.edu/department/directories/faculty-directory/bryan-morse/), and [Gus Hart](https://physics.byu.edu/department/directory/hartg) on a daily basis. I love linear algebra and its applications, I live in the terminal with [neovim](https://neovim.io/), and my favorite textbook is [High-Dimensional Data Analysis with Low-Dimensional Models: Principles, Computation, and Applications](https://book-wright-ma.github.io/), which I just call "High-Dim, Low-Dim."

I am a believer in [open collaboration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_collaboration) and am grateful for the community of open-source developers who make my life better.

I am currently conducting research in computational cryo-ET, using both classical and deep ML methods to identify low-signal macromolecular complexes in tomograms. This research allows us to achieve the near-atomic scale resolution needed to understand fundamental life processes.

On a more personal note, I love to read fantasy, snowboard, and teach my three
sons that it was actually Leibniz, not Newton, who invented calculus.
